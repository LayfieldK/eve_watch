This is an android app that I created to assist Eve Online players in keeping aware of current events in the game while they were away from it.  Eve Online is an MMORPG where players' assets and characters continue to exist even when they are not playing the game.
This app periodically makes requests to the Eve Online API to scan for events that pertain to the user's characters.  For example, a character could have finished building a spaceship or learned a new skill, or his corporation could have had war declared on it by a rival faction.  The app would then push a notification to the user's device letting him or her know what has been going on while they've been away from the game.

I created the app just so that I could dip my toes back into Java and also App development, as I had never done so in the past.  I recognize many mistakes and some poor design decisions in the code now, but what's done is done.

I stopped maintaining the app years ago because I stopped playing the game, but I have left the app on the Google Play store so that players can still make use of it before it is totally deprecated by the evolving API and game of Eve Online.

The app can be found on the Google Play store here - https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.evewatch
